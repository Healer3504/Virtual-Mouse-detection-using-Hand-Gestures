# Virtual-Mouse-detection-using-Hand-Gestures
The Virtual Mouse Detection project aims to develop a system that allows users to control the mouse pointer through hand gestures using computer vision techniques. This project utilizes a webcam to track hand movements and detect specific gestures to simulate mouse actions such as moving the cursor, leftclicking, right-clicking, double-clicking.
